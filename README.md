# Hessian-Matrix-Multivariate-Optimization

**Aim:**

Develop a Python function (Multivariate Optimization) to compute the Hessian matrix for a given scalar-valued function of multiple variables.

**Theory:**

In mathematics, the Hessian matrix or Hessian is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. Hessian matrices belong to a class of mathematical structures that involve second order derivatives. They are often used in machine learning and data science algorithms for optimizing a function of interest. The Hessian matrix is a mathematical tool used to calculate the curvature of a function at a certain point in space.
The formula for Hessian Matrix is given as

**Conclusion:**

The Hessian matrix provides valuable information about the curvature of a scalar-valued function of multiple variables. It can help in determining whether a critical point is a local minimum, maximum, or saddle point.
